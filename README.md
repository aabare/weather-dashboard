Weather Dashboard

Introduction

The Weather Dashboard was created for Challenge 6 and includes JavaScript, HTML, Bootstrap, Third Party APIs and Server-side APIs files. The Weather Dashboard allows the user to search a particular city. It will give the temperature, humidity, wind speeds and uv index and a five day forecast.

Usage 

Once on the Weather Dashboard the user searches a specific city. For example, if the user wants to know what the weather in New York City is, they will type New York City into the search box. Once the user hits search, the weather for the current date in the city will be displayed including the temperature, humidity, wind speed and uv index. The search will also display the five day forecast including the humidity and the temperature.
